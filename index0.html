    <center><h1>GLitch in the Routine</h1></center>
    <p> Presented to you is a world of constant attachment to technology and social media.
        With our daily routines and privacy being corrupted by the internet, we have come to
        the realization that our societal world is slowly deteriorating. Although the internet
        helps us connect with others far and near, it jeopardizes developing a core connection
        with ourselves.Many things can stem from obsession with social media and technology,
        such as depression, anxiety and other mental health issues.</p>
    <p> This project was made with 2 canon rebel t3i dslr cameras and touchdesigner. Filming
        subjects were ourselves in our every day weekly routines. </p>
